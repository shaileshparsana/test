# Inchoo_PHP7

PHP 7 compatibility extension for Magento 1 by Inchoo. Article with some tests and stats: http://inchoo.net/magento/its-alive/ .

## Compatibility
Tested on M CE 1.9.2.2 & 1.9.2.3. Reported working on M EE 1.14.2.2. Older versions of Magento may work, but may also have other problems, not fixed by this extension.

If you can, upgrade to freshest Magento core first. If you can't, this may be a good starting point to make a branch for older versions.

Backwards compatible with PHP. Tested by us on PHP 5.6 & 5.5. Users have reported it working fine even on 5.3.3. Installing the extension before switching to PHP 7 is a good idea.

## License
MIT. (See LICENSE.txt).

## Issues
Yes. _(Of course.)_ See Issues tab. Issue reporting is welcome. Pull requests are welcome.

## Installation
For Composer install, available on Firegento: http://packages.firegento.com/ .

Or just download ZIP and copy files to appropriate locations.

## Notes

### PHP 7 & mod_php
If you are using mod_php (quite common on development localhosts), remember to edit your .htaccess file, because settings under

    <IfModule mod_php5.c>

will not be set. You can leave that block in case of reverting to PHP 5, but add something like this one too:

    <IfModule mod_php7.c>
        php_value memory_limit 256M
        php_value max_execution_time 18000
        php_flag session.auto_start off
    </IfModule>

### &new in /lib
There is some very old code in `lib/PEAR` and `lib/Varien/Pear` that uses `&new`. This is removed from PHP 7, but we were never able to reproduce the crash in real life so it's not fixed by this extension. The only way we were able to reach the code was when compiling **all** code to opcache.

*If you ever trigger this code in real use, please let us know!*

If you are doing opcache compiling, workaround is simple - put these two folders into opcache blacklist (see opcache.blacklist_filename php.ini setting).

### Memcache
As investigated by Ivan Weiler:

It seems native php memcache extension currently has problem with session_regenerate_id(). Same situation was with php-redis few moths ago, php7 changed something related to session_regenerate_id that broke similar php extensions.

For example, it won't work if you simply try:

    session_save_path('tcp://localhost:11211?persistent=1&weight=2&timeout=10&retry_interval=10');
    session_module_name('memcache');

    session_start();
    session_regenerate_id(); // throws Catchable fatal error !!

So, Magento is just using built in session handler for memcache, which isn't working at the moment. It seems php-memcache needs to be fixed, not Magento, and it will be eventually.

I also tested memcacheD, which is newer extension and it seems memcached is working, so maybe it can be used instead in Magento. You can try installing php memcached extension (it's php-memcached on Ubuntu) and change `local.xml` to something like this:

    <session_save><![CDATA[memcached]]></session_save>
    <session_save_path><![CDATA[localhost:11211]]></session_save_path>

memcached instead of memcache, tcp:// removed for memcached. I never used memcached in production, but it works for me on my dev machine, login works.
